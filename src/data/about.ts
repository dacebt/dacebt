      "Narrator: Career, huh? Everyone’s got one, but yours sounds like it’s been a few different ones. Where did it actually start?",
      "You: In what feels like a former life, I spent over ten years living the chef’s life—but I’ll save those details for another time. After discovering coding lessons on freeCodeCamp, I decided to change direction. From that point on, every decision needed to move me closer to becoming a programmer.",
      "Narrator: From kitchens to code... quite the leap. What was the moment you knew it wasn’t just a hobby anymore?",
      "You: Passing my first major test on freeCodeCamp.org. I picked things up quickly, but then hit a roadblock—what now? How do I share? Who do I talk to? With no connections in the industry, I knew I had to break in. I enrolled in a full-stack bootcamp with one clear goal: make a friend.",
      "Narrator: Smart move. Sometimes one real connection beats a dozen certificates. Did that plan work out the way you hoped?",
      "You: More than I could’ve imagined. The financial Hail-Mary paid off—I excelled in the course, made several connections, and built a great relationship with the instructor who became my first mentor in tech.",
      "Narrator: Sounds like the right gamble. Every good story needs that first mentor moment. So what came after graduation—straight into the industry?",
      "You: Things moved fast. I stayed on to assist at the program after graduation to reinforce my fundamentals and stay connected. Not long after, I met Parker from Decent Labs. A short client contract with them turned into a full-time role—and that’s where my career really launched.",
      "Narrator: From chef to developer—quite the arc. Seems like every bold step paid off. Guess this is where the adventure really begins.",

    id: "full-stack",
    label: "Full Stack",
    messages: [
      "Narrator: Full stack... what do you mean?",
      "You: I mean I’m a full-stack developer—comfortable using any technology to get the job done. JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, Solidity, backend or frontend—you name it, I’ll figure it out.",
      "Narrator: Impressive confidence. But surely you favor one side over the other?",
      "You: Hard to say. Most of my work has leaned frontend, but in the web3 space the frontend often *is* the backend. You end up working across the whole stack whether you mean to or not.",
      "Narrator: Great! Being able to tackle problems without being limited by technology is essential. Just don’t forget—the foundations of programming always matter.",
      "You: Agreed.",

      "Narrator: So, before the code—there were knives, heat, and a kitchen full of chaos. What kept you in that world for a decade?",
      "You: The challenge. I started as a dishwasher in a pizza place but didn’t stay there long before I was tossing dough like the best of them. From there I worked at bars, family restaurants, and mom-and-pops before moving up to AMC Fork & Screen—probably my favorite job. Restaurant plus movie theater? Hard to beat.",
      "Narrator: That sounds like trial by fire—and grease. What pushed you to keep climbing instead of burning out like most do in that industry?",
      "You: Curiosity. I was never satisfied with 'that’s how it’s always been.' I loved finding ways to make things more efficient and prevent mistakes through preparation and organization. But that curiosity also revealed a truth—I cared more about the process than the food itself.",
      "Narrator: That’s the mark of an engineer hiding in a chef’s coat—caring more about systems than seasoning. So when did you know it was time to hang up the apron?",
      "You: In a small, hot Pittsburgh kitchen. I wasn’t happy. I wanted to code, to be part of a different culture. I found a data-entry job—anything to get me in front of a computer. Best decision I ever made. It gave me time to code on the side, sharpen my typing, and learn office culture. When we moved back to Georgia, I finally had the confidence to apply to the bootcamp.",
      "Narrator: From sauté pans to spreadsheets—that’s quite the pivot. Sounds like that data-entry job was the bridge that turned frustration into momentum.",
