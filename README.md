I'm a **Senior Web Engineer** with a passion for building, period. After a decade in the culinary world, I made the leap to software development and haven't looked back. I'm a full-stack developer comfortable working across the entire stack—from React frontends, to microservices, to Solidity smart contracts, and everything in between.

**What drives me:** (What the AI thinks anyway, It's close enough)
- Building scalable, performant applications
- Solving complex problems with elegant solutions
- Leveraging AI tools to 10x my development workflow
- Continuous learning and sharing knowledge
